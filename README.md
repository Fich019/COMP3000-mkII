## Technology Used
  The primary software used is Visual studio and OpenGL. The language C++ was used as this is one of the primary languages used for OpenGL rendering. Inside of OpenGL libraries such as: Glew, Freeglut, Glut, glm and glad were used throughout this project.
  
## Understanding the code
  My project is a aim trainer built inside of OPENGL. I started with a camera and player movement script from learnOpenGL and a shader and built up from there. I started by creating walls, a floor and a ceiling to enclose the player in a box. From there I stopped the player leaving said box so they would remain in the playable area. There is a different coloured wall on the back which draws the players eyes to it. This is the main wall where the targets are located. The player can then aim at the targets with the crosshair provided on screen and use left click on their mouse to "shoot" at them and destroy them. The target is then randomly placed somewhere else on the wall. I got the idea from playing first person games myself, I want somewhere to warm up my aim and to practice before playing. Granted this has already been done before many times but I wanted to have a go at as it is something that I am interested in and enjoy. It combines my interests into one.
